        <p class="para">I am a proud holder of <abbr title="Bachelor of Science">Bsc</abbr> in Mathematics and
          Statistics. I have had experience as Auditor of Pensions for 6 months with the Rivers State Government, I also
          had quite an exposure as I taught Senior secondary school teacher, with high impact of effective teaching both
          in Mathematics and Physics. I also analyze the forex markets alongside synthetics, I am a fast learner, and I
          have this believe that if I truly put my mind to something, then I can achieve it!! Life has taught me that it
          is indeed a parallel space in a world of nothingness, I take my time in evaluations, both good and bad. I have
          great people skills. I am also a badass real-life Portrait artist been drawing since kindergarten three, I've
          built my skills in different capacity with the use of digital softwares like Civil 3D used by Civil Engineers,
          SPSS a statistical package used by statisticians and other sectors, including the development of a basic CRUD
          App using the Flask or Django frameworks. I have quite an experience with use of Python language and an
          intermediate level of Javascript programming. I like to refer to myself as a cool Techie, Tech is lovely and
          all my life, I've wanted to be in the tech sphere, glad to be in it. You should join in too, you won't ever
          regret it!! </p>

        <p class="para">My experience in Code Plateau alongside Zuri has been one of a kind, sincerely I must say, I am
          indeed lucky and at the same time really grateful to be a part of the tech sphere of ZUri and Code Plateau. I
          have been opportuned to meet great minds of all sorts as youths in their prime trying to grasp a chunk of the
          Tech sphere, It makes
          youths to learn to slove problems by themselves, rather than looking for who will assist them with problem
          solving. With my intermediate knowledge of coding, in humility, I don't hope to be perfect, I only wish to be
          among the greats. Thank you CODE PLATEAU!!! Thanks Zuriri!!</p>
